# Web Sockets

For sketches that use connectivity, a _web sockets_ server is needed, unfortunately not provided by Five Server.

To host your code remotely, it's recommended to try one of these options:

* Gitpod
* CodeSandbox
* Glitch

[Read more on how to set these up](https://github.com/ClintH/ixfx-demos-npm/blob/main/remote-machine.md)

## Run on your own machine

### Step 1. Install Node.js

[Instructions](./install-nodejs.md)

### Step 2. Install packages

At the root of the demos folder, run `npm install`.

### Step 3. Run

Now that the two preliminary steps are complete, you will just have to run the server when you like:

```
npm start
```

Use CMD/CTRL+C to stop the server.
